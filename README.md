# 📚 TAMU Studys - Collaborative Learning Platform for Texas A&M Students

Welcome to TAMU Studys, a community-driven Q&A and discussion platform designed for Texas A&M University students. This project aims to foster a collaborative learning environment where students can ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss class material with peers in a structured, class-specific space.

# 🎓 Purpose

TAMU Studys combines the features of Stack Overflow and Reddit to provide a supportive space for students to:

Ask questions about specific classes
Share insights and solutions related to assignments, homework, and projects
Discuss lecture material and exam preparation strategies
Collaborate with classmates in a constructive and respectful way
🛠 Features
Class-Specific Threads: Organized discussion spaces for each class, allowing students to easily find and contribute to discussions about their specific courses.
Question & Answer Format: A Q&A structure similar to Stack Overflow, enabling students to upvote answers and select the most helpful response.
Community Moderation: Students can upvote and report content to maintain a positive and relevant learning space.
Tags & Filters: Tag questions by topic (e.g., "Homework", "Exams", "Labs") for easier navigation and filtering.
User Profiles: Earn reputation points, badges, and achievements based on contributions, encouraging participation and rewarding helpfulness.
Real-Time Notifications: Receive updates on answers, comments, and mentions, ensuring users stay engaged with relevant discussions.

# 💡 Why TAMU Studys?

Traditional online forums lack the structure to support class-specific discussions. TAMU Studys addresses this by focusing on Texas A&M courses. Whether you're a freshman or a senior, TAMU Studys offers an organized space to connect with classmates, gain insights, and succeed in your courses.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
