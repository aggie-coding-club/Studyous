# 📚 TAMU Studys - Collaborative Learning Platform for Texas A&M Students

Welcome to TAMU Studys, a community-driven Q&A and discussion platform designed for Texas A&M University students. This project aims to foster a collaborative learning environment where students can ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss class material with peers in a structured, class-specific space.

# 🎓 Purpose

TAMU Studys combines the features of Stack Overflow and Reddit to provide a supportive space for students to:

Ask questions about specific classes
Share insights and solutions related to assignments, homework, and projects
Discuss lecture material and exam preparation strategies
Collaborate with classmates in a constructive and respectful way
🛠 Features
Class-Specific Threads: Organized discussion spaces for each class, allowing students to easily find and contribute to discussions about their specific courses.
Question & Answer Format: A Q&A structure similar to Stack Overflow, enabling students to upvote answers and select the most helpful response.
Community Moderation: Students can upvote and report content to maintain a positive and relevant learning space.
Tags & Filters: Tag questions by topic (e.g., "Homework", "Exams", "Labs") for easier navigation and filtering.
User Profiles: Earn reputation points, badges, and achievements based on contributions, encouraging participation and rewarding helpfulness.
Real-Time Notifications: Receive updates on answers, comments, and mentions, ensuring users stay engaged with relevant discussions.

# 💡 Why TAMU Studys?

Traditional online forums lack the structure to support class-specific discussions. TAMU Studys addresses this by focusing on Texas A&M courses. Whether you're a freshman or a senior, TAMU Studys offers an organized space to connect with classmates, gain insights, and succeed in your courses.
